/**
 * Pushes similarity function-call expressions below a join if possible.
 * Assigns the similarity function-call expressions to new variables, and replaces the original
 * expression with a corresponding variable reference expression.
 * This rule can help reduce the cost of computing expensive similarity functions by pushing them below
 * a join (which may blow up the cardinality).
 * Also, this rule may help to enable other rules such as common subexpression elimination, again to reduce
 * the number of calls to expensive similarity functions.
 * Example:
 * Before plan:
 * assign [$$10] <- [funcA(funcB(simFuncX($$3, $$4)))]
 * join (some condition)
 * join_branch_0 where $$3 and $$4 are not live
 * ...
 * join_branch_1 where $$3 and $$4 are live
 * ...
 * After plan:
 * assign [$$10] <- [funcA(funcB($$11))]
 * join (some condition)
 * join_branch_0 where $$3 and $$4 are not live
 * ...
 * join_branch_1 where $$3 and $$4 are live
 * assign[$$11] <- [simFuncX($$3, $$4)]
 * ...
